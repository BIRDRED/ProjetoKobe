# PROJECT KOBE -  CLASSIFICATION SHOTS KOBE BRYANT :basketball:

**PROJECT KOBE** is a tool that uses **streamlit**, **sklearn** and **mlflow** to detect which Kobe Bryant shots would be hit or not and we have a web application where these shots can be selected according to the use and distance of these throws.
This project is a fun and interesting way to explore the power of real-time classification. We will help you configure and run **PROJECT KOBE** in your environment.

## Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your development environment:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- streamlit
- mlflow
- pycaret
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
